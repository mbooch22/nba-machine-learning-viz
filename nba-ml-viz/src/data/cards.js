Change color so that each profitable game is green and each non-profitable game is red.</li>",

      "<li> Using NBA statistics over the course of the last decade, a Machine Learning model (MLM) was trained using AWS Amazon Sagemaker in order to predict statistics for future games.</li><li>Using a separate proprietary web scraping web app, NBA stats over the past decade were retrieved for every game played.</li><li>After retrieving and configuring all the advanced statistics from the Web Scraping app, the data was used to train a Machine Learning Model on AWS Amazon Sagemaker.</li><li>The predictions of the MLM are used against the corresponding Vegas Odds. Various thresholds are used to determine the optimal chances of the model being more accurate than Sports-books.</li><li>The goal of the Predictive MLM is to have a winning percentage of at least 60% against the Vegas Odds. That would prove to be a profitable model. All projections will be based on $100 wagers.</li><li>Eventually the MLM will have to be re-trained with the new data that is available. This is the best way to get the most accurate predictions. As of now, the last time the MLM was trained was February 25, 2021.</li>",
